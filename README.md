See all icons and usage here: https://

### Sizing

By default, icons will be sized based on the font size of the parent element.

You can set a custom size using the `size` attribute. 
For multiple based sizing, pass the desired multiple followed by an `x`.

By default, icons' color is `#000`.
You can set a custom color using the `color` attribute.

```html
<anchor-icon size="2.5x" class="custom-class"></anchor-icon> 
```

You can also set a `px` size directly by just passing an integer

```html
<anchor-icon size="24" class="custom-class"></anchor-icon> 
```

## Tree shaking

By using ES imports like `import { AnchorIcon } from 'vue-sailor-icons'` with [webpack + minifier](https://webpack.js.org/guides/tree-shaking/#minify-the-output) or Rollup, unused exports in this module will be automatically eliminated.

To make webpack tree shaking work without using any minifier, you can use the per-file icons from [`icons`](https://unpkg.com/vue-sailor-icons/icons/) directory, e.g. `import AnchorIcon from 'vue-sailor-icons/icons/AnchorIcon'`.
